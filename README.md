## Features
List is W.I.P (There are lots of features not written here)

<details>
	<summary><b>Engine</b></summary>
	
	- Custom Entity Component System (using entt as back-bone while providing systems that manages components)
	- Multi-Threaded tasks execution (Job-system)


</details>
<details>
	<summary><b>Assets</b></summary>
	
	- All assets are loaded/imported asynchronously.
	- Uses Assimp to import 40+ 3D model formats.
	- Uses Freeimage to import 30+ image formats.
	- Uses libsndfile to import 20+ sound files formats.
	- All imported assets are exported into a unified formats for faster loading.
	- All imported assets have a meta file that describes further loading.
	- Every asset is identified with a unique UUID given on its creation.
	- Section W.I.P

</details>
<details>
	<summary><b>Graphics</b></summary>

	- Dynamic light Component (Directional & Point & Spot)
	- Flexable Material System (using different pipelines/shaders/textures for every material)
	- Shadow Mapping for all light sources.
	- PBR With Image Based Lighting shaders.
	- Section W.I.P

</details>
<details>
	<summary><b>Audio</b></summary>

	- Uses OpenAL or XAudio2 as a low-level backends
	- Section W.I.P

</details>
<details>
	<summary><b>Physics</b></summary>

	- PhysX 4.1 integration
	- Section W.I.P

</details>
<details>
	<summary><b>Scripting</b></summary>

	- C# Scripting through Mono
	- Section W.I.P

</details>


## Building

Follow the instructions below to compile and run the engine from source.
If you wish to build with another compiler/platform, please note that:
  - The engine requires a C++20 compiler and currently only supports x64 platforms (support for x32 is planned)
  - The engine doesn't contain platform-specific code and is written with cross-platform portability in mind, so porting to other platforms should be easy.

## Windows

* Visual Studio 2022 or newer is required if you wish to build the solution directly
* Clone repo & submodules
* Run **RunCmakeForDependencies.bat**
* Compile Assimp & Diligent & OpenAL-soft found in External/CmakeProjects
* Download and compile the remaining dependencies (PhysX & FreeImage & Freetype & msdf-atlas-gen 'as static lib')
* Run **CopyDependenciesBinaries.bat**
* Open `Nuclear Engine.sln` and set your solution configuration and platform
* Compile 

## Other Platforms
  - Planned platforms: 
    - Desktop: Linux - MacOS
    - Mobile: Android - IOS
	
Consoles are planned but not a priority now...

## RoadMap
  - V0.01 Alpha:
    - Complete RenderSystem (50%) 
	- Complete AudioSystem Implementation. (75%) 
	  - Fix AudioSource/Listener Velocity change callbacks
	  - Add Support for streaming AudioClips
	  - Add AudioCapture support (Microphones)
	- Basic Implementaion of PhysX.
	- Complete Samples & their documentation.

## Current To-dos 
  - W.I.P:
    - CPU & GPU Queries & Memory/Performance Profilers
  	- Use CMake instead of Visual Studio / Port to linux.
    - New Rendering Effects (Fog - SSAO - SSR - Motion Blur)
	- PostProcessing effects should be processed per camera not only in the main camera.
	- Start implementing 2D sprite rendering (+ start implementing GUI/Text Rendering)
	
  - On-Hold:
    - Text rendering (text tile-set creation finished)
	- Basic Editor support (Nuclear Editor).
	- Finish reflecting the C++ api to the C# scripting assembly (prob provide a build-time solution that builds a binding lib?)
  	- Serializing the scene & assets.

  - TODO:
  	- CSM
	- FIX BRDF generation in IBL Pipeline
	- Clean and document Samples.
	- GUI (basic widgets)
